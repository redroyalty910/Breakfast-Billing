# Breakfast-Billing
"Breakfast Billing" was a lab assignment that I completed on June 10th of 2024. It utilized the elementary fundamentals of structures in C++ and the manipulation of assets within a structure for a real-life purpose. The idea was that the user would input a number on the menu (one through eight) that corresponds with a breakfast item that they desired, followed by how many orders of that item they wanted, rinse and repeat, until they are done ordering food. The final output is an exact reciept of the users entire transaction. Included within this repository is a cpp file and a text file. The text file holds the contents of the assigned menu; 8 items, accompanied by the name of the eight items and their respective price. The cpp file refers to this text file and utilizes the data from within that file to perform basic mathematic operations to caclculate a given users information regarding their purchase.
