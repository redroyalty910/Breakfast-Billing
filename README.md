# Breakfast-Billing
"Breakfast Billing" was a lab assignment that I completed on June 10th of 2024. It utilized the elementary fundamentals of structures in C++ and the manipulation of assets within a structure for a real-life purpose. The main idea was that the user would input a number on the menu that corresponds with a breakfast item they desired, followed by how many of that item, rinse and repeat until they are done ordering. The final output should be an exact reciept of the users transaction. Included within this repository is a cpp file and a text file. The text file holds the contents of a menu; 8 items, accompanied by the name of the eight itema and their respective price. The cpp file refers to this text file and utilizes the data from within that file to perform basic mathematic operations to caclculate a given users information regarding their purchase.
